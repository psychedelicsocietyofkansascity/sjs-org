Welcome to **Safe Journey Sanctum** — a peer‑led initiative providing compassionate support for individuals undergoing non‑ordinary states of consciousness at live events across the Midwest.

Safe Journey Sanctum provides compassionate support to individuals navigating non‑ordinary states of consciousness at festivals and events. Such states can be induced by psychedelics or other experiences and may be overwhelming without adequate preparation; our harm‑reduction approach includes methods to help prevent and transform challenging experiences. We educate the public on how to support someone experiencing a non‑ordinary state and offer care services at events across the region.

Our vision is a community where harm‑reduction principles transform difficult experiences into opportunities for growth. Whether you're curious about our work, in need of support, or looking to volunteer, we're here to provide a safe sanctuary.
