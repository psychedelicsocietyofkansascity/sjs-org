Safe Journey Sanctum is growing. Over the last year, we’ve supported countless festival‑goers and community members experiencing non‑ordinary states of consciousness, and we’re expanding our offerings to meet growing demand.

Our mission remains grounded in harm‑reduction principles: compassionate care, consent‑first support and evidence‑based techniques. Taking psychedelics can lead to overwhelming experiences, especially without preparation; harm‑reduction methods help prevent and transform these experiences【724214290913739†L28-L35】.

This autumn we’re excited to announce several new initiatives:

- **Monthly Integration Circles:** Starting in September, these community gatherings provide space for people to process experiences and learn grounding techniques.
- **Harm‑Reduction Training Workshop:** On August 15 we’re hosting a half‑day workshop covering trauma‑informed peer support, consent, and overdose response.
- **Festival Outreach:** Look for our sanctuary at the Heartland Music Festival this September.

We’re also recruiting volunteers who are passionate about compassionate presence and listening. You don’t need to be a therapist—our volunteers rely on compassion and a desire to hold space rather than advice【280826686719651†L88-L103】.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of our community!
