Safe Journey Sanctum is growing. For our second ever event, we attended Getter at the Warehouse On Broadway with over 500 people!

Our mission remains grounded in harm‑reduction principles: compassionate care, consent‑first support and evidence‑based techniques. Taking psychedelics can lead to overwhelming experiences, especially without preparation; harm‑reduction methods help prevent and transform these experiences【724214290913739†L28-L35】.

This autumn we’re excited to announce several new initiatives:

- **Monthly Integration Circles:** Starting in September, these community gatherings provide space for people to process experiences and learn grounding techniques.
- **Harm‑Reduction Training Workshop:** On August 15 we’re hosting a half‑day workshop covering trauma‑informed peer support, consent, and overdose response.
- **Festival Outreach:** Look for our sanctuary at the Heartland Music Festival this September.

We’re also recruiting volunteers who are passionate about compassionate presence and listening. You don’t need to be a therapist—our volunteers rely on compassion and a desire to hold space rather than advice【280826686719651†L88-L103】.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of our community!
