Welcome to the online home of **Safe Journey Sanctum**.

We are honored to introduce a new peer-led initiative designed to provide compassionate, trauma-informed support for individuals navigating nonordinary states of consciousness at festivals, concerts, and other live events.

Our mission is to offer safe, supportive spaces based on consent-first principles, evidence-based harm reduction practices, and a deep respect for personal journeys.

Stay tuned here for updates, event announcements, volunteer opportunities, and educational resources.

Together, we create sanctuary.
