## What is Safe Journey Sanctum (SJS)?
Safe Journey Sanctum (SJS) provides trauma-informed, consent-based peer support to individuals experiencing intense emotional or psychedelic episodes at music festivals, concerts, and community events. We focus on compassion, evidence-based guidance, and honoring individual experiences in a supportive environment.

## What services does SJS offer at events?
At events, we offer peer support services, distribute Narcan (naloxone) to immediately address opioid overdoses, and provide educational resources to attendees. Our trained volunteers help individuals safely navigate challenging experiences, reducing the risk of trauma and harm.

## Are there opportunities for training or education provided by SJS?
Yes. SJS hosts Narcan and CPR classes open to the community, designed to equip individuals with critical life-saving skills. Additionally, we provide specialized training for event staff on de-escalation techniques and safe administration of Narcan to handle emergencies effectively.

## How does SJS manage liability at events?
Safety is our top priority. To effectively manage liability, SJS partners closely with on-site medical teams at events. Our role complements medical professionals, offering immediate peer support and intervention until professional medical assistance can take over. Our volunteers undergo rigorous training and follow strict operational protocols to ensure safe, professional, and responsible service.

## Can anyone volunteer with SJS?
Yes, we welcome volunteers who align with our values and mission. Interested individuals must undergo our specialized training sessions focusing on trauma-informed care, consent-based interaction, de-escalation skills, and emergency response.

## How can my event partner with SJS?
Event organizers interested in partnering with us can reach out directly via our contact page. We provide consultation, collaboration, and customized support strategies tailored specifically to your event's unique needs and requirements.

## What is a non‑ordinary state of consciousness?
Non‑ordinary states of consciousness can occur during intense emotional or psychedelic experiences. Taking psychedelics can result in overwhelming and uncomfortable experiences—particularly for first‑time users, at high doses, or without adequate preparation.  Our harm‑reduction model includes methods to help prevent and transform challenging experiences while in such states.

## What does harm reduction mean in the context of psychedelics?
Harm reduction is an approach that provides education, peer support and safe spaces to reduce potential harms associated with non‑ordinary states. We offer care services at events, helping anyone in need of emotional support. Our sanctuaries are comfortable and well‑lit, with pillows, cushions, art supplies and volunteers who listen without judgment. By transforming difficult experiences into opportunities for learning and growth, harm‑reduction practices honour individual journeys without encouraging substance use.

## How can I prepare for a festival or event experience?
Plan ahead and look out for your friends. Use a buddy system—agree to stick together and check in throughout the day. Familiarize yourself with the event layout: know where exits, water and food stations, bathrooms, harm‑reduction and first‑aid services are. If you choose to use substances, avoid mixing drugs and start with a small amount. Tell someone you trust what you believe you are taking, and consider visiting a harm‑reduction tent or drug‑checking facility. Learn to recognize signs of an overdose and carry naloxone. Most importantly, pace yourself: drink water, rest in the shade, and eat regular meals to stay comfortable and hydrated.
