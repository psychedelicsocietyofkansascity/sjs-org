## What is Safe Journey Sanctum (SJS)?
Safe Journey Sanctum (SJS) provides trauma-informed, consent-based peer support to individuals experiencing intense emotional or psychedelic episodes at music festivals, concerts, and community events. We focus on compassion, evidence-based guidance, and honoring individual experiences in a supportive environment.

## What services does SJS offer at events?
At events, we offer peer support services, distribute Narcan (naloxone) to immediately address opioid overdoses, and provide educational resources to attendees. Our trained volunteers help individuals safely navigate challenging experiences, reducing the risk of trauma and harm.

## Are there opportunities for training or education provided by SJS?
Yes. SJS hosts Narcan and CPR classes open to the community, designed to equip individuals with critical life-saving skills. Additionally, we provide specialized training for event staff on de-escalation techniques and safe administration of Narcan to handle emergencies effectively.

## How does SJS manage liability at events?
Safety is our top priority. To effectively manage liability, SJS partners closely with on-site medical teams at events. Our role complements medical professionals, offering immediate peer support and intervention until professional medical assistance can take over. Our volunteers undergo rigorous training and follow strict operational protocols to ensure safe, professional, and responsible service.

## Can anyone volunteer with SJS?
Yes, we welcome volunteers who align with our values and mission. Interested individuals must undergo our specialized training sessions focusing on trauma-informed care, consent-based interaction, de-escalation skills, and emergency response.
