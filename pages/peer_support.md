Our peer support model is built upon the principles of:

- **Trauma-informed care**
- **Consent-first support**
- **Evidence-based techniques**
- **Non-directive presence**

We take inspiration from established models such as the Zendo Project and NEST while tailoring our approach to the needs of the Midwest festival community.
