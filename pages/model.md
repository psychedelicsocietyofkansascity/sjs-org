Our peer support model is built upon the principles of:

- **Trauma-informed care**
- **Consent-first support**
- **Evidence-based techniques**
- **Non-directive presence**

We take inspiration from established models such as the Zendo Project and NEST while tailoring our approach to the needs of the Midwest festival community.

Our sanctuaries are designed to be inviting and comfortable. Inspired by the Harmonia Sanctuary, our tents are well lit, with soft floors, pillows, cushions and blankets so guests can make themselves at ease. In the corner you might find a box of books, art supplies and bubble wands, while an altar offers beautiful objects like gemstones and seashells. Most importantly, there is always someone—often several volunteers—available to talk.

Volunteers at SJS are not therapists; they rely on compassion, awareness and a desire to hold space. Rather than giving advice or guiding anyone's experience, they listen and acknowledge whatever arises. Our training equips volunteers with trauma‑informed care skills, consent‑first communication, de‑escalation techniques and overdose response so they can offer grounded support and know when to seek medical assistance.

We believe challenging experiences can be transformed into opportunities for learning and growth. By combining comfortable environments with compassionate presence and evidence‑based practices, our model helps individuals integrate their experiences and fosters community resilience.
