Safe Journey Sanctum (SJS) was founded to provide trauma‑informed, consent‑based peer support to individuals navigating intense emotional or psychedelic experiences at music festivals, concerts, and community events. Our mission is rooted in the belief that challenging experiences can be transformed into opportunities for learning and healing.

We draw inspiration from established psychedelic peer‑support models like the Zendo Project and Harmonia Sanctuary. These organizations demonstrate that providing comfortable, well‑lit spaces with pillows, cushions, books, art supplies and compassionate volunteers helps guests feel safe. In our sanctuaries there is always someone available to listen without judgment, offering presence rather than advice.

Our vision is a world where harm‑reduction education and peer support are readily available so that individuals exploring non‑ordinary states feel resourced, supported and respected. We offer trainings, collaborate with event organizers, and share resources to make this vision a reality.
