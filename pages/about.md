Safe Journey Sanctum (SJS) was founded to provide trauma-informed, consent-based peer support to individuals navigating intense emotional or psychedelic experiences at music festivals, concerts, and community events.

We believe in compassionate presence, evidence-based support, and honoring individual journeys.
