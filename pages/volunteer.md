**Want to become part of Safe Journey Sanctum?**  
We offer training sessions to prepare volunteers to offer grounded, compassionate support.

**[Volunteer Application Form](https://forms.gle/your-google-form-link)**

Volunteer roles include:
- Peer Counselors
- Harm Reduction Educators
- Event Liaisons
- Logistics Coordinators

Our volunteers come from diverse backgrounds, and you do not need to be a therapist or mental health professional to get involved. Compassion, awareness, and the willingness to listen are at the heart of peer support【280826686719651†L88-L103】. Volunteers are trained in trauma‑informed care, consent‑first communication, de‑escalation, Narcan administration, and emergency response.

During events, volunteers staff our sanctuaries—comfortable, well‑lit spaces equipped with pillows, cushions and creative supplies where guests can rest and express themselves【280826686719651†L76-L83】. Volunteers offer presence rather than advice and know when to involve medical personnel or security if a situation requires professional intervention.

Besides on‑site roles, volunteers help with outreach, fundraising, training facilitation and logistics. We foster a supportive community that values continuous learning and reflection. If you are passionate about harm‑reduction and compassionate care, we invite you to apply and join us in creating sanctuary.
