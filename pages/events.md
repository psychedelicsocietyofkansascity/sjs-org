Our team supports festivals, concerts and community gatherings across the Midwest. We regularly host harm‑reduction workshops and integration circles where we practise compassionate listening and teach techniques like de‑escalation and Narcan administration.

**Upcoming events:**

- **Monthly Integration Circle – First Tuesday of every month:** Gather with peers to share experiences and learn grounding techniques.
- **Harm‑Reduction Training Workshop – August 15, 2025:** A half‑day workshop covering trauma‑informed peer support, consent, and overdose response.
- **Festival Outreach – September 2025:** We'll provide sanctuary services at the Heartland Music Festival. Come say hello at our tent!
